	abstract = "For a non-zero integer N, we consider the problem of finding 3 integers (a, b, c) such that (formula presented). We show that the existence of solutions is related to points of infinite order on a family of elliptic curves. We discuss strictly positive solutions and prove the surprising fact that such solutions do not exist for N odd, even though there may exist solutions with one of a, b, c negative. We also show that, where a strictly positive solution does exist, it can be of enormous size (trillions of digits, even in the range we consider).",
